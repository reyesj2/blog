# Getting Started with Vue.js

Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework that makes building user interfaces a breeze. In this post, we'll explore the basics of Vue.js and create our first application.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:
- Node.js installed on your system
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

## Creating Your First Vue App

The easiest way to start a Vue project is using the create-vue tool:

```bash
npm create vue@latest my-first-app
cd my-first-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Understanding Vue Components

Vue components are reusable pieces of code that include:
- Template (HTML)
- Script (JavaScript/TypeScript)
- Style (CSS)

Here's a simple example:

```vue
<template>
  <div class="greeting">
    <h1>{{ message }}</h1>
    <button @click="changeMessage">Change Message</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'

const message = ref('Hello Vue!')

function changeMessage() {
  message.value = 'Vue is awesome!'
}
</script>

<style scoped>
.greeting {
  text-align: center;
  margin-top: 2rem;
}
</style>
```
